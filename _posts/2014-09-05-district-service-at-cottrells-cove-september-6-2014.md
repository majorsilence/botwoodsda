<p>There will be no church services at the Botwood SDA Church on Sabbath, September 6 because everyone is invited to attend the Cottrell's Cove Church on that day.&nbsp; Sabbath School will begin at 10 am and the church service at 11 am.&nbsp; Following the service there will be a potluck lunch held at the church.&nbsp; Hope to see you there.</p>

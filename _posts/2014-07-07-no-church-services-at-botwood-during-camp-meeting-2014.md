<p>Camp Meeting 2014 is soon approaching.&nbsp; July 18-26 Seventh-day Adventists all across Newfoundland and visitors from far and near will gather at <a href="http://sda24.adventistchurchconnect.org/article/7/woody-acres" target="_blank">Woody Acres</a> for our annual Camp Meeting.&nbsp; For more information and applications see the <a href="http://sda24.adventistchurchconnect.org/article/7/woody-acres" target="_blank">Woody Acres</a> web page.&nbsp; Because Camp Meeting will fall on two Sabbaths, there will not be any church services at Botwood, Cottrell's Cove or Grand Falls-Windsor those two Sabbaths--July 19 and 26.&nbsp; We'd love to see you at Camp Meeting this year, especially on either or both Sabbaths.</p>

<p>There will be no church service held in Botwood on Sabbath, October 4, 2014.&nbsp; We will be congregating in Cottrell's Cove to share fellowship with the members of the Cape Freels' SDA Company.&nbsp;&nbsp; Come along for a wonderful Sabbath of singing, praying and worship.&nbsp; Bring your favourite potluck dish to share after the service.&nbsp; Hope to see you there!</p>
